## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### If You're Choosing: Lump-Sum 2x vs Monthly Non-Leveraged

**✅ Choose Lump-Sum 2x if**:
- 10+ year timeframe (93%+ win rate in S&P/DJIA/NASDAQ)
- Can accept 1-7% chance of underperformance
- Want 3-6x median outcome multiplier

**✅ Choose Monthly Non-Leveraged if**:
- 5-year timeframe (16-29% chance of winning)
- Risk-averse (better 10th percentile at 5 years)
- Investing in Nikkei or emerging markets (28-29% win rate for non-lev)

---

### If You're Choosing: Monthly 2x vs Monthly Non-Leveraged

**✅ Choose Monthly 2x if**:
- Accept 73-91% win probability
- Want 4-8% higher median returns
- Can stomach worse downside (10th percentile consistently negative)

**✅ Choose Monthly Non-Leveraged if**:
- Risk-averse (better downside at ALL percentiles)
- 9-26% chance of winning is acceptable
- Want consistent positive outcomes (10th percentile usually positive)

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**The percentile tables reveal**:

1. **Lump-sum 2x is the clear winner** for long-term growth:
   - 98% win rate at 15 years (S&P/DJIA)
   - Median: 3-6x higher final values
   - Even 10th percentile beats non-lev at 15 years

2. **Monthly 2x has diminishing advantage**:
   - Win rate: 73-91% (lower than lump-sum)
   - Median gap narrows from 7.1% → 6.8% → 7.6% over time
   - Consistently worse downside protection

3. **Non-leveraged is downside insurance**:
   - Wins 10th percentile in most scenarios
   - 2-29% overall win rate
   - Best choice for Nikkei (29% win rate at 5 years)

**Choose based on percentile you can accept**:
- Want 50th percentile (median) or better? → Lump-sum 2x
- Need 10th percentile (worst 10%) protection? → Non-leveraged
