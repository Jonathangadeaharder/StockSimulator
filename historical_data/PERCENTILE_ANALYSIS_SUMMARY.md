# Percentile Performance Analysis: $500/Month Investment Strategies

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document analyzes the **distribution of returns** for three $500/month investment strategies using percentile statistics (10th, 25th, 50th/median, 75th, 90th percentiles).

**Three Strategies:**
1. **Monthly $500 → 2x Leveraged ETF**
2. **Monthly $500 → Non-Leveraged Index**
3. **Lump-Sum → 2x Leveraged** (reference)

**Key Question**: What returns can you realistically expect at different probability levels?

## 📊 Percentile Interpretation Guide

- **10th percentile**: Only 10% of outcomes were worse (90% were better)
- **25th percentile**: Only 25% of outcomes were worse (75% were better)
- **50th percentile (median)**: Half of outcomes were better, half were worse
- **75th percentile**: 75% of outcomes were worse (only 25% were better)
- **90th percentile**: 90% of outcomes were worse (only top 10% achieved this)

**Example**: If 10th percentile return is -5%, this means 90% of historical periods did better than -5%.

---

### 4. **Risk vs Reward by Strategy**

#### Monthly $500 → 2x Leveraged:

**Characteristics**:
- 10th percentile: -8.67% to +3.57% (can lose money)
- Median: 9.59% to 15.39%
- 90th percentile: 15.77% to 26.65%

**Verdict**: Lowest upside, significant downside. Squeezed between lump-sum (better upside) and non-leveraged (better downside).

---

#### Monthly $500 → Non-Leveraged:

**Characteristics**:
- 10th percentile: -3.42% to +2.94% (best downside protection)
- Median: 4.86% to 7.75% (conservative returns)
- 90th percentile: 8.12% to 14.24% (limited upside)

**Verdict**: Insurance strategy. Wins in worst scenarios, sacrifices median and upside potential.

---

#### Lump-Sum → 2x Leveraged:

**Characteristics**:
- 10th percentile: -18.13% to +6.13% (high downside risk)
- Median: 14.25% to 27.88% (best typical outcome)
- 90th percentile: 25.38% to 56.64% (massive upside)

**Verdict**: Aggressive growth strategy. Highest median and upside, but worst downside in crashes.

---

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations Based on Percentiles

### If You Can Accept 10% Chance of Loss:

**Use Lump-Sum 2x Leverage**

Why: You'll get **best median outcome** (14-28% annualized) with massive upside (90th percentile: 25-57%).

**Risk**: 10% chance of losing money at 5 years in volatile markets (NASDAQ 10th percentile: -7.39%).

---

### If You Need Capital Preservation:

**Use Monthly Non-Leveraged**

Why: **Best downside protection**. At 10th percentile:
- Non-leveraged: -3.42% to +2.94%
- Lump-sum 2x: -18.13% to +6.13%

**Trade-off**: Median outcome is half of lump-sum (5-8% vs 14-28%).

---

### If You Want "Best of Both Worlds":

**Problem**: Monthly 2x doesn't deliver.

- Downside: -8.67% to +3.57% (worse than non-leveraged)
- Median: 9-15% (worse than lump-sum 2x)
- Upside: 16-27% (worse than lump-sum 2x)

**Recommendation**: Don't use monthly 2x. Pick either lump-sum 2x (growth) or non-leveraged (safety).

## 🎯 Market-Specific Percentile Insights

### S&P 500 & DJIA (Stable Markets):

**10th percentile**: Non-leveraged wins at 5 years only
**25th+ percentile**: Lump-sum 2x dominates completely

**Strategy**: Use lump-sum 2x unless starting at obvious market peak.

---

### NASDAQ (High Volatility):

**10th percentile at 5 years**: Lump-sum 2x can lose -7.39%
**Median**: Lump-sum 2x delivers 28% (highest of all markets)
**90th percentile**: Lump-sum 2x can deliver 48% at 5 years, 33% at 15 years

**Strategy**:
- High risk tolerance: Lump-sum 2x (massive upside)
- Risk-averse: Monthly non-leveraged (10th percentile still positive)

---

### Nikkei 225 (Structural Risk):

**10th percentile**: Non-leveraged wins at ALL timeframes
**25th percentile**: Non-leveraged wins at 5 & 10 years
**Median+**: Lump-sum 2x wins

**Key Difference**: Only market where non-leveraged wins at **25th percentile** (bottom quartile of outcomes).

**Strategy**:
- Conservative: Monthly non-leveraged (wins in 25% worst outcomes)
- Aggressive: Lump-sum 2x (but accept 10th percentile: -10.86% at 15 years)

---

## 💰 The Bottom Line

### What Percentile Analysis Reveals:

**1. Lump-Sum 2x dominates median and upside**:
- Median: 14-28% annualized (vs 5-8% for non-leveraged)
- 90th percentile: Can turn $90k → $2.7M-$6.4M

**2. Non-Leveraged is essential downside insurance**:
- 10th percentile: +0.39% to +2.94% (vs -18% to +6% for lump-sum)
- Nikkei 25th percentile: Only positive strategy

**3. Monthly 2x has no clear use case**:
- Downside: Worse than non-leveraged
- Median: Worse than lump-sum
- Upside: Worse than lump-sum

From $90,000 invested over 15 years:

| Strategy | S&P 500 | DJIA | NASDAQ | Nikkei |
|----------|---------|------|--------|--------|
| Monthly 2x Lev | $369k | $376k | $767k | $373k |
| Monthly Non-Lev | $194k | $197k | $274k | $205k |
| Lump 2x Lev | **$766k** | **$664k** | **$1,592k** | **$986k** |

**Lump-sum 2x delivers 2x to 4x higher median outcome than non-leveraged.**

### Probability of Beating Non-Leveraged:

If you choose lump-sum 2x over monthly non-leveraged:
- **S&P 500/DJIA**: ~80-95% chance you'll be glad you did
- **NASDAQ**: ~75-89% chance you'll be glad you did
- **Nikkei**: ~68% chance you'll be glad you did

**BUT**: In the 5-32% of times it fails, you could lose 10-20% vs staying safe with non-leveraged.

## 🏁 Final Recommendation

**Use percentiles to match your risk tolerance**:

### Aggressive (Top Quartile Acceptable):
→ **Lump-Sum 2x** (75th percentile: 22-31% annualized at 15 years)

### Moderate (Median Acceptable):
→ **Lump-Sum 2x** (median: 14-28% annualized)

### Conservative (Want 75% Confidence):
→ **Monthly Non-Leveraged** (25th percentile: 2-6% annualized, always positive)

### Risk-Averse (Want 90% Confidence):
→ **Monthly Non-Leveraged** (10th percentile: -3% to +3%, best protection)

**The data is clear**: Monthly non-leveraged is insurance that costs you median returns but protects downside. Lump-sum 2x is growth that delivers 2-4x better median outcomes but has catastrophic downside risk.

Choose based on whether you can afford the 10-25% chance of significant losses.
